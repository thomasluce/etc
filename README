etc. Is a simple stack-machine language in the vein of BrainFuck.

I thought it was funny to see a bunch of *aaS service advertising, "Java, .NET,
Node, PHP, etc.", and thinking, "what is etc? Why you no document!" So I
thought I would resolve the ambiguity. I bring you, etc..

It's a simple stack machine with the following operations:

... : Increment the pointer
..  : Decrement the pointer
.   : Input and place byte at pointer
'   : Output the byte at the pointer
    : (Two space characters) Increment the byte at the pointer
    : (A single space) Decrement the byte at the pointer
\n  : Skip next instruction if value at pointer is 0
\t  : Skip next instruction if value at pointer is > 0
/   : Go to instruction at the value of the current pointed to memory. So, if
      pointer is 0, and mem[0] == 4, go to the 4th instruction.
